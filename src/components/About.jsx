        "Hi there! I'm Ayat Talib, a WordPress developer who loves bringing ideas to life through clean and responsive websites. I've been diving into the world of web development for a few years now, and it's been an exciting journey of learning, creating, and growing.

As an IT student, I’m always curious about new technologies and trends. Lately, I’ve been exploring React and Next.js, which has opened up so many possibilities for building fast and dynamic websites.

I’m passionate about helping startups and businesses create an online presence that truly represents them. Whether it’s designing from scratch or refining existing ideas, I enjoy every step of the process. Let’s work together to create something amazing!"
