        Hi there! I&apos;m Ayat Talib, a WordPress developer who loves bringing ideas to life through clean and responsive websites. 
        I&apos;ve been diving into the world of web development for a few years now, and it&apos;s been an exciting journey of learning, creating, and growing.
        <br /><br />
        As an IT student, I&apos;m always curious about new technologies and trends. Lately, I&apos;ve been exploring React and Next.js, which has opened up so many possibilities for building fast and dynamic websites.
        <br /><br />
        I&apos;m passionate about helping startups and businesses create an online presence that truly represents them. Whether it&apos;s designing from scratch or refining existing ideas, I enjoy every step of the process. Let&apos;s work together to create something amazing!
